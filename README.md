## System

Win 10 Tweaker has a proprietary system for removing Defender that is not available in other programs. Here you can get rid of annoying Windows warnings, useless Defender, SmartScreen, UAC, disable memory diagnostics, unnecessary network protocols, and also prevent USB flash drives from automatically running to avoid virus intrusion on your computer. And Group Policy works with Win 10 Tweaker even on Windows 10 Home.

## Services

In this category, only services that can be safely disabled are collected. The unique configurator, based on the proprietary Tweakinarium, allows you to customize services based on your computer usage patterns. And the intelligent mode for Pro version users allows for a deeper analysis to disable additional unnecessary components. Watch the explanatory video to familiarize yourself with this powerful category.

## Cleaning

No other program can boast such a vast cache knowledge base as Win 10 Tweaker. Win 10 Tweaker contains knowledge accumulated over 15 years of studying the Windows operating system, starting from Windows XP. Everyone who performs a full clean with Win 10 Tweaker for the first time experiences a brief shock from the sheer amount of files removed from the system. Starting from version 18.0, Win 10 Tweaker now has neural network junk scanning - the first artificial intelligence in the history of Windows Cleaning.

## Confidentiality

The first category of Win 10 Tweaker is designed to rid your operating system of data collectors and processors that gather information about your activity. Applying tweaks from this category will improve the overall performance of your computer by deeply cleaning the task scheduler from unnecessary services for the user, as well as completely removing explicit spies that come pre-installed with Windows.
